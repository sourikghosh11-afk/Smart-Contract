# 🧠 BlockQuiz – A Blockchain-Powered Quiz Game

Welcome to **BlockQuiz**, a decentralized quiz game built on the Ethereum blockchain using **Solidity**.  
Players can test their knowledge, answer on-chain questions, and earn rewards — all transparently on the blockchain.

---

## 🚀 Project Description

**BlockQuiz** is an educational and entertaining blockchain application designed for beginners exploring **Solidity** and **smart contract development**.

With BlockQuiz, you can:
- Learn how to write and deploy smart contracts.
- Understand how data (like quiz questions and answers) is stored on-chain.
- Experiment with reward systems, ownership logic, and blockchain transparency.

## 💡 What It Does<img width="1920" height="1080" alt="Screenshot 2025-10-29 140612" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/796d7a4d-63d6-4d7a-9e7c-0bd718e66087" />


1. **The Owner (Quiz Creator)** deploys the contract and adds quiz questions with answers and rewards.  
2. **Players** interact with the smart contract by submitting their answers directly through the blockchain.  
3. The contract automatically checks if the answer is correct.  
4. If correct — the player earns points (or ETH if extended).  
5. Every question, answer, and score is recorded on the blockchain — no central database required.
